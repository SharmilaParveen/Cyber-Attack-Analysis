# Cyber-Attack-Analysis
Project Title: Cyber Attack Analysis Dashboard

Objective: Create an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize cyber attack data, enabling stakeholders to identify patterns, trends, and potential threats.

Scope:

- Data Collection: Gather data from various sources, including threat feeds, online news sources, and internal security systems.
- Data Visualization: Use Tableau to create interactive visualizations, including:
    - Geospatial Analysis: Utilize maps to display the geographic distribution of cyber attacks.
    - Proportional Analysis: Employ pie, donut, and tree map charts to illustrate the proportion of cyber attacks by type, sector, and region.
    - Trend Analysis: Leverage area chart to show the trend of cyber attacks over time.
    - Comparative Analysis: Use lollipop charts to compare the number of cyber attacks across different countries and organizations.

 Dashboard Features:
    - KPIs: Display key performance indicators (KPIs) to track the number of cyber attacks, affected systems, and response times.
    - Interactive Filters: Allow users to select specific date ranges, industries, and attack types using parameters and filters.
    - Drill-Down Capabilities: Enable users to view detailed information about specific cyber attacks using dashboard actions and quick table calculations.
    - Grouping and Aggregation: Use grouping, combined fields, and calculated fields to perform advanced data analysis and aggregation.

Goals:

- Improve incident response times by identifying patterns and trends in cyber attacks.
- Enhance threat intelligence by analyzing data from multiple sources.
- Provide stakeholders with actionable insights to inform cybersecurity strategies.

Target Audience: Cybersecurity professionals, incident responders, and stakeholders interested in cybersecurity trends and threats.

Technical Requirements:

- Tableau Desktop or Server (version 10.5 or later)
- Data sources (e.g., CSV, Excel)
- Advanced knowledge of data analysis, visualization, and dashboard design using Tableau.
